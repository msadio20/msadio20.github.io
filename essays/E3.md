In the past two weeks we have worked on 2 WODs, BrowserHistory6 (https://msadio20.github.io/ITM352_repo/WODS/BrowserHistory6/index.html) and SmartPhoneProducts_variables (https://msadio20.github.io/ITM352_repo/WODS/SmartPhoneProducts1_variables/products_display.html). For BrowserHistory6 we were tasked to edit BrowserHistory3 so that it would be divided into pages that reflect the respective browser. We focused on being able to use onclick, hoverover, and linking pages to the index file. For SmartPhoneProducts_variables we focused on using scripts and "document.write()" to replace hard coded text. We then linked a JavaScript file to our HTML so that the HTML file has the framework and the JavaScript has the meat of the webpage.

My experience with performing the WOD went well. I skimmed over the instructions before beginning the WODs which I believe helped cutting down time so that I could meet the Rx goals. As I worked on the WODs I became more and more confident and paid less and less attention to minor aspects of my code. This in turn caused me more time trying to find the mistakes. This was increasingly frustrating which led me to making more mistakes. However, once I found the errors in my code the rest of the WOD was a breeze.

To prepare I reviewed the corresponding texts and screencasts included in the Modules. This really helped cut down time and effort because I was able to discern what the WOD was asking of me. Another thing that I did to prepare was skimming over the instructions before beginning the WOD. By skimming I was able to complete the WODs smoothly since I had an idea of what would come next after completing a step.

Something I could have done better was taking my time. I was focused on completing the WODs within the Rx goal that I often sacrificed double checking my work. This worked against me, however, because I had to go back and check for errors when I loaded my code and the output was far from what I needed. For the next WOD I will try to take my time while completing it and also read the text more carefully so I don't make careless mistakes.
