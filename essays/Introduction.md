I am Ma Donna Sadio, a fourth-year student working towards a B.B.A. in Management Information Systems at the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa.

After the COVID-19 pandemic halted the last quarter of my senior year, I saw the sacrifices and struggles of all healthcare professionals. I also saw the importance of no-contact doctor visits. Seeing how I presented a version of this to my Capstone panel just a few weeks beforehand, I was intrigued to learn more about computer science and information systems. It took me two years in college to decide to part with medicine and study business. When I decided to study business, I didn't consider majoring in MIS. My significant other told me that it may be something that would interest me, and I took the opportunity to explore the field. I found great interest in Information Systems and hope to establish a fulfilling and lasting career in this field.

Thank you.
